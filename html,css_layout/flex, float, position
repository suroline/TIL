When to use flex, float, position.

Actually always when you want. But when it is related to Service operating, i need to think about which one is the best solution for the next when i'll do some update.

1. flex

- always great, but new function so some internet browser doesnt work well.

2. float

- it is good to use when the inside of the contents can get longer. It's  because i can use clear:both; and make a block at the bottom. It will keep the parent height.

3. position

- when i won't have any content's that will be updated, it is useful and easy.

Also I have grid-layout function, but its still updating so i need to keep follow does updating.
